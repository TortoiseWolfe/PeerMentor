## Process New Requests (bottom to top)
- [ ] Read ticket → check Discord for updates/edits
- [ ] **Already resolved** → congratulate, assign self, move to Done
- [ ] **Needs admin** → respond with escalation message, assign to coordinator, tag in Discord
- [ ] **You can help** → @mention student, guide (don't give full answers), assign self, move to In-Progress
- [ ] **Unfamiliar topic** → comment that you looked but lack expertise, leave unassigned

## Check In-Progress
